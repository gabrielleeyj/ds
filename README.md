# ds
ds or Death Star for short. An experimental repository for me to learn Rust

Basic Architecture (Star Wars themed naming conventions just for fun)
UI is called Portal
Backend is called Death Star
Database is called Holocron

Ensure you have Rust installed:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Once done run `docker build -t <whatevername>` to build the image.
Finally do a `docker run <whatevername>` which will run/start the container image.
